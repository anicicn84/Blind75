## Explanation of the approach

To solve the problem of removing the `nth` node from the end of a linked list, we can use a two-pointer approach. The idea is to have two pointers: a fast pointer and a slow pointer. The fast pointer advances `n` steps ahead of the slow pointer. Then, both pointers move at the same pace until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the slow pointer will be right before the `nth` node from the end. We then adjust the next pointer of the slow pointer to skip the `nth` node, effectively removing it from the list.

### A step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a dummy node and set it to point to the head of the list. **This dummy node will help handle edge cases, such as removing the head of the list.**
2. Set both the slow and fast pointers to start from the dummy node.
3. Move the fast pointer `n+1` steps ahead to create a gap of `n` nodes between the slow and fast pointers.
4. Move both pointers at the same pace until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
5. Once the fast pointer is at the end, the slow pointer will be right before the `nth` node from the end. Adjust the next pointer of the slow pointer to skip the `nth` node.
6. Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the modified list.
